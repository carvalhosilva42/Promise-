66,'Private Network - The system requires a “back-end” private network environment in order to ensure that end-user operations (on the front-end) are not impeded by database backups, index propagations, or other large back-end data transfers. ',L
66,'The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable. ',L
66,'ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes. These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system. These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.

66,'Backup Software – Data and application backups will be managed through fully supported backup software solutions. ',L
66,'HTTP and GIS Server Applications – As the Web will be the primary delivery protocol for the application, HTTP and related GIS server applications will be required to support system functionality. ',L
66,'Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins – In support of External Interface requirements, commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture. The use of Browser plug-ins will be judiciously restricted on an as-needed basis. ',L
66,'Email Services– As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information from the system, email server applications will be required to support system functionality.',L
66,'The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO. This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C# , MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server. ',L
66,'The system will make data available in standardized data formats such as tab-delimited text for use on users’ client systems including local installations of ARC GIS software or other off-line software applications.',L
66,'The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system. The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users. The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately. For additional details see Appendix E. User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use without training), complete (users can perform all functions from the interface), and consistent (buttons and wording are the same throughout the system).',L
66,'No extra hardware interfaces are needed. The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools. This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.  ',L
66,'The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO. This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol. ',L
66,'Load Balancing - Application Servers and Database servers must be load balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability. Specific scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-managed load balancing need to be addressed in the functional requirements specification. ',L
66,'A tutorial will provide a quick start, a walk-thru of major system features, and further reference source for the complete system features. ',L

66,'Implement a database of STEWARDS metadata elements. The database will provide browse and query functionality.',L
66,'Online Storage - The system needs to be able to store hundreds of megabytes of data on demand. The potential for needing Gigabytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities. Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs. ',L
66,'Establish a database in support of CEAP that will house the collective data assembled or generated during research activities. The database will support a variety of data types and formats, including but not limited to: spatial data - vector, raster, imagery, and tabular; tabular data – static and time-series; spreadsheets; documents; reports; photographs; and URL links. ',F
66,'The use of agricultural models (SWAT, AnnAGNPS) is a core element of the CEAP effort. Several modeling-related database topics will need to be addressed: 1. Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial components of GIS data, and in modeling output. Reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database. 2. Models will require specific input data and will generate output data during the calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios. The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output. ',F
66,'View entire universe of watersheds from top-level screen for selection and Design tools to navigate the individual watershed sites and their data. ',F
66,'View watershed descriptive data and Summary descriptions of research watersheds, stations, and instruments that are useful in describing the research activities should be accessible. This information would not be considered ‘formal’ metadata. ',F
66,'Provide access to the data via browsing of sites, stations, and instruments; allow for simple queries to individual datasets; provide a metadata search tool to query dataset parameters; and allow for downloading of datasets (full or partial). ',F
66,'Users may wish to examine time-series data, e.g. stream discharge data, over a user-specified time frame in order to select only those data desired for download. Charting tools in association with the query engine are desirable. ',F
66,'Provide access to CEAP-related reports, tables, and project documents.',F
66,'Agricultural research data are inherently spatial in nature. STEWARDS will provide web-based geographic information tools to allow site-specific data to be viewed within their spatial context. These tools will provide browse and query functionality and support links to download spatial data and their associated tabular data.',F
66,'Develop and maintain a metadata database that provides browse and query access to formal descriptions of the database elements. Provide tools for database contributors to create and upload metadata compatible with the STEWARDS metadata database. ',F
66,'Develop search tools that query watershed, station, and instrument metadata across the STEWARDS database. Metadata query tools will support query by location, theme, and keyword.',F
66,'The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFox. ',O
66,'The System shall operate on Certified and Accredited servers running the current corporate approved versions of operating systems as appropriate. ',O
66,'The Data Management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate Intranet and, if a user is authorized for outside access through the corporate firewall, from an Internet connection at the user’s home. ',O
66,'Much of the initial effort in CEAP will focus on the use of agricultural models (e.g. SWAT, AnnAGNPS) in the CEAP watersheds. Users will be able to examine the data used in the modeling effort, visualize the results in their spatial context, and download the model input data and results.  ',F
66,'The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.',PO
66,'Implement a web-based browse-and-query tool for searching STEWARDS metadata. Queries by location, theme, and keyword will be supported. A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particular querying parameters and then save them for reference later such that time-based comparisons are facilitated with minimal user training. ',L
66,'Implement a metadata input tool that supports creating and editing of metadata in the chosen format. The metadata tool will allow for local and web-based input and editing. A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particulars of a data set, and then save those answers and relate them to a particular project, so that these selections can be re-used in future uploading operations. ',L
66,'The Data Research and Reporting portion of the system shall provide public access to reviewed and approved data sets.  ',O

The current Federal standards for spatial data are the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version 2.0), (http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/contstan.html), FGDC-STD-001-1998. There are some indications that the Federal government may implement the ISO 19115 geographic information/metadata standard in the future. If this occurs, the CEAP database team will evaluate conversion of metadata. ',L
66,'The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability. The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week). For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern. ',A
66,'Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately. STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate. Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features. ',SE
66,'The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product. Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process. The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available. ',SE
66,'STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations. STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components. They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.',SE
66,'Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost. Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.

66,'Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in. ',PE
66,'Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases. Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.',PE
66,'This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments. ',PO
66,'STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication.

',F
72,'For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.). When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able to toggle whether notifications are turned on. By default, they should be turned on for announcements.

72,'The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users. ',PE
72,'This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load. It is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it.

If the actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an option to search all courses.',F
72,'One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system. These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, wiki pages, and announcement pages. An actor in the role of course administrator should be able to optionally upload multiple files where he or she finds that such as feature would be useful—such as on a devoted project page. ',F
72,'For this requirement, page refers to any distinct upload point (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.).',F
72,'The system must allow for multiple file upload to be configured on a per-page basis. ',F
72,'Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file uploads on a page of his or her choosing. For collaborative projects, it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts. Such a construct should be offered to the actor during a page’s creation and editing stages.',F
72,'The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where appropriate. ',F
72,'One of the shortcomings of the current courseware system is that the foreign language department is unable to capture and track voice clips—recorded by students—for oral homework over the course of a student’s education. ',F
72,'The system must allow actors to organize their voice clips into a portfolio. ',F
72,'Equal and finite drive space needs to be allotted to each actor in the role of professor or administrator to allow for the storing of voice clips recorded and submitted by all actors in the roles of students. Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to partition this space for actors in the roles of students. This can be done one of two ways: 1) the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived. The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips. The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a preview has taken place. The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file. Thus, if the actor chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips. ',F
72,'Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses. The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where uploads are permitted. ',F
72,'The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio. ',F
72,'The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexible format. ',F
72,'Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems. Voice clips should be downloadable for archival purposes or for the purpose of presenting them to other actors. ',F
72,'The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech. ',F
72,'The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate. ',F
72,'The system must allow actors to delete recorded clips. ',F
72,'In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google. ',F
72,'Second, a single page should be dedicated specifically to the task of searching the course management system. In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or components) of the course management system. Results should appear in categories (e.g., Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance. In this case, relevance is determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms. When the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the search result. ',F
72,'First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a “Search” button on the top or bottom of every page. More information on this topic is given in sub-section 3.4.2 below. ',F
72,'Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching for material in a given course. The search feature should be present in two ways.  ',F
72,'Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to catalog voice recordings. Recordings should only be converted to MPEG Audio (mp3) format  when they are being downloaded; a separate viewer should be provided in a cross-platform language for listening to clips in Moodle. ',F
72,'Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used. Too many steps to complete basic actions—such as submitting an assignment—lead to frustration on the part of the actor. A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management system. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki page, or a forum post. ',F
72,'An actor must be able to search through pages in a course. ',F
72,'Actors in the course administrator role may not feel the need to provide web feeds for every page in their course. During the creation and editing of a page, that actor should be able to toggle web feed availability. ',F
72,'The system must allow web feeds to be turned on or off on a per-page basis. ',F
72,'If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to efficiently keep track of a course’s current affairs. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.). ',F
72,'The system must be able to display web feeds, such as RSS 2.0 feeds, for all pages of the course management system where elements such as forum posts, assignment postings, announcements, wiki alterations and other blocks of information that an actor may view are added. Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain.',F
72,'Since voice clips should be stored in a portfolio for each actor during his or her existence in the course management system, he or she should be able to examine his or her portfolio to select and delete clips if he or she chooses to. This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use to judge improvement over time.',F
72,'The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead of using hierarchical links. ',F
